# DialogueSystem
**A Dialogue system made in Unity3D with C#**

This is a system made to make it possible to have conversations with NPCs when they are clicked on.
When a conversation is being held the player should not be able to start conversations with other NPCs untill the conversation is over.

**Features**

- *All text is being read from a .xml file*
- *You can add as many player responses as you want, the program will take care of it*
- *You can easily change the part of the .xml that should be read*
- *You can use it on as many NPCs as you want*
- *You can easily give each NPC unique lines & responses either loaded from 1 universal .xml or seperate per-NPC-files* 
- *You can easily add additional functionallity via the .xml to make the player's choices inpact more than just the dialogue*
